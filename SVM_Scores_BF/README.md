#### The figures are SVM scores for all the principle components. The file name format is plot_phX_bfY.png ph stand for phase, bf for binning factor. X is 0, 5, 10, 15. Y runs from 2 to 82 in steps of 10.

#### So plot_ph5_bf52.png is the SVM score for all PC's for Phase 5 and Bin factor 52.

#### The plot with lowerst binning factor (i.e. 2.0) has highest resolution and that of highest binning factor (i.e. 82) has lowest resolution.
